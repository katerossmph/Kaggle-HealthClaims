## Executive Summary

This report represents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a synthetic healthcare claims dataset.

Key insights include:

-   **Population Demographics:** The patient population is split evenly by gender, with concentration in the 30-70 years of age range. Age-gender pyramids highlight expected healthcare utilization patterns.

-   **Clinical Case Mix:** Most common conditions include [Top conditions Here]. Distribution of conditions varied by age and gender.

-   **Utilization Patterns:** Admissions fluctuated weekly and don't show any day-of-week patterns. Length-of-stay (LOS) varies by condition and admission type.

-   **Cost Drivers:**

-   **Data Quality:**

-   Correlation Insights

The goal is to simulate a claims analyst workflow, focusing on:

-   Data quality assessment

-   Utilization trends (admissions, length of stay)

-   Cost analysis (billing, insurance variation)

-   Case mix and demographics

-   Clinical variation (conditions, medications, results)

-   Reproducible analytic documentation

These analyses mirror tasks typical for health systems, payers, ACOs, and government health policy agencies.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
